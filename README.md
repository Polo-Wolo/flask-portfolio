# portofolio

This is the static build of my portfolio : [demo](https://polo-wolo.github.io/portfolio/)

I made it with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

All data are stored in a Json file so I can easly maintain my website.

Have a nice day ! Polo-Wolo
